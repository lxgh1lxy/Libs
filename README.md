# What is Libs
Libs is an easy to use Discord Madlib bot that brings fun and joy to your Discord server. 
# What is this Repo for?
This repo is used to create the madlibs behind Libs, and we want you to be able to submit your own madlibs to add to Libs, so you can feel proud of something.

# How do I upload something?
Simple. Just open the file madlibs.json, and follow this format below when creating your Madlib:
****The format****
**{
            "title": "The name of your madlib",
            "blanks": ["noun", "verb", "etc."],
            "value": ["Your actual story, making sure to leave a space where the blank is supposed to go " , "Then add a quotation mark, then a comma, then another quotation mark " , "Like this"]
        },**
        Listed above is an example of how to use the format.
        # What are the sections of the format?
        **Title**: The name of your madlib
        **Blanks**: What the user sees and responds to. (Ex. Noun, Verb)
        **Value**: The full story without the blanks.
        If you follow this format, you should be all good to go.
        Just type in your story, and press "Suggest Changes"
        # How does my story get accepted
        Your story will be reviewed and tested by a moderator. If we approve it, it will be added into the story list. If it's declined, no worries, you can always try again!
        ****YOU CAN SUBMIT UNLIMITED STORIES****
